If you've enjoyed my work and would like to give me a little more time to dedicate to it, I'll happily take any Monero or Bitcoin you'd like to throw my way:

### Monero or Bitcoin/Lightning via BTCPay Server

You can easily donate Bitcoin (on-chain or via Lightning) or Monero via my BTCPay Server instance:

{{< btcpayserver >}}

## Lightning via Lightning Address

You can easily donate Bitcoin via Lightning to my Lightning Address:

`seth@btcpay.sethforprivacy.com`
