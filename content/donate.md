If you've enjoyed my work and would like to give me a little more time to dedicate to it, I'll happily take any Monero or Bitcoin you'd like to throw my way:

### Monero or Bitcoin/Lightning via BTCPay Server

You can easily donate Bitcoin (on-chain or via Lightning) or Monero via my BTCPay Server instance:

{{< btcpayserver >}}

## Bitcoin via Silent Payments

If you're already jumping on the Silent Payments train and have a wallet that supports sending to a Silent Payment address, a fantastic way to donate and support my work is using the privacy-preserving Silent Payment address below:
